Another one-off script for painless installation of [Rundeck](http://rundeck.org).

This is not a replacement for proper configuration management tools, and it's only been 
tested with Ubuntu 10.04 - Use at your own risk!

To use:
```bash
$ curl https://raw.github.com/influenza/blog-snippets/master/RundeckInstaller/install.sh | bash -s
```
